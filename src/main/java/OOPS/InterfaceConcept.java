	// hide complete implementation logic in interface
	// cannot create object of interface
	// by default all methods are abstract no need to explicitely define method
	// as abstract
	// interface only and only static and final vars by default they are static
	// and final don't need to write
	// only when u want to hide complete implemetation logic--use interface
	//performance wise slow that abstract method
	//travercing point of view --first need to go parent then child class methods
